For almost 40 years the Automation Steeg und Hoffmeyer GmbH has been a reliable and competent partner for the production of semi- and fully automated machinery for glass and pharmaceutical industry.
Many of the individually designed machines, e.g., palletizer, extraction and transport conveyors, gripping systems and pullers or lifters are still in daily use. Although we are moving into a new area of ​​business we still offer after-sales-services for the glass and pharmaceutical industry.
