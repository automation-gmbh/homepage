**We develop concepts, special machines and system solutions for the Fiber-Placement-Technology!**

In recent years, the relatively old **fiber-placement-technology** is experiencing a renaissance. We define this technology as the automated, direction- and position-variable, successive placement of unidirectional fiber bundles. The resulting fiber architectures are infiltrated in a subsequent processing step with a reactive polymer.
Compared to the traditional manufacturing of fiber architectures, the processing costs can be cut down approximately 45-70 % and the material costs might be lowered, due to waste minimization to a min. of 55 %.  
Compared to our competitors, we offer non-standardized solutions. We offer customized solutions. All concepts have to be designed towards customers environment and products.
