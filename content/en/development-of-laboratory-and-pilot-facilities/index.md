**We develop laboratory and pilot facilities for the automated manufacturing of fiber-reinforced composites along the entire value chain!**

An important issue for the **implementation** of **new processing technologies** is to **test** their performance on a **laboratory** or **pilot facility**. All information of the concept and design studies are bundled and further developed into a full-scale machine, ready for production. With the experience from over **100 prototypes**, we offer our know-how to shorten development cycles and to collect the essential data for scaling up to a real manufacturing standard.
In the field of laboratory and pilot facilities, we offer the **entire portfolio of development** consultancy:

* physical and theoretical models and corresponding analysis
* the design of machines,
* the construction,
* plant engineering and factory layout, including control and data acquisition,
* ending in the design of large industrial scale systems.  

All concepts could be subjected to a critical customer profitability analysis.
