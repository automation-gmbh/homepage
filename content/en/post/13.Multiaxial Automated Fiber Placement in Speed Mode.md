title: "Multiaxial Automated Fiber Placement in Speed Mode"
---

The Automation Steeg and Hoffmeyer GmbH has developed a fiber placement technology with a constant tool center point speed of up to 2 m/s. Two prototypes have been built and are available for demonstrations and production patterns in our factory.
So that the automation could be successfully implemented, new solutions in the handling of the semi-finished fibers, drive technology, the control unit and weight reduction of the moving machine parts had to be combined.
