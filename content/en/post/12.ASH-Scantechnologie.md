Within the F2-Composite-Project we developed a technology to scan surfaces and bodies of FRPC. The technology is commonly used to detect certain quality parameters in a continuous production e.g. tapes.

* Surfaces could be detected with several synchronized scanners
* There is no contact to the object
* All acquired data can be evaluated online/offline
* High scanning frequencies allow scanners or objects to be traversed while scanning
* Software is adapted to customerâ€™s specification
