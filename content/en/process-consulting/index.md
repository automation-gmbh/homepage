**You want to built components made ​​of fiber-reinforced composites with automated machines at high quality assurance, and you are looking for suitable processing methods, [we offer our knowledge…](/contact/)**

We will advise you about possible process chains and pros and cons of different process routes. The focus is primarily on continuous fiber-reinforced systems. Basis for any consultation process is a technical analysis, an economic analysis, and as a result we will derive a suitable technical and economically solution.

**Field of tension for composite solutions**
